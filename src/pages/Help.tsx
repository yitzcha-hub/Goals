      },
      {
        question: 'What is the 0-10 progress system?',
        answer: 'Our unique 0-10 system lets you rate your progress on any goal from 0 (not started) to 10 (fully achieved). This simple scale makes it easy to track incremental progress and see how far you\'ve come. Just slide the progress bar to update your current level.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I use the app without creating an account?',
        answer: 'You can explore the demo to see how the app works, but to save your goals and track progress over time, you\'ll need to create a free account. Your data is securely stored and synced across all your devices.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I set up milestones for my goals?',
        answer: 'When creating or editing a goal, click "Add Milestone" to break your goal into smaller, achievable steps. Each milestone can have its own target date and description. Completing milestones helps you stay motivated and see tangible progress.'

    questions: [
      {
        question: 'How often should I update my progress?',
        answer: 'We recommend updating your progress daily or at least a few times per week. Regular check-ins help you stay accountable and give you accurate data for your progress charts. Set up reminders to help build this habit.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I have multiple goals at once?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! You can track as many goals as you want. However, we recommend focusing on 3-5 key goals at a time for the best results. You can always archive completed goals and add new ones.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens when I complete a goal?',
        answer: 'When you reach 10/10 on a goal, you\'ll see a celebration animation! The goal is marked as complete and moved to your achievements. You can view your completed goals anytime to see how far you\'ve come.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I edit or delete a goal?',
        answer: 'Yes! Click on any goal to open its details, then use the edit or delete options. Editing lets you change the name, description, or milestones. Deleting a goal is permanent, so we\'ll ask you to confirm first.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do goal categories work?',
        answer: 'Categories help you organize goals by area of life: Health, Career, Finance, Relationships, Personal Growth, etc. You can filter your dashboard by category and see progress charts for each area.'

      },
      {
        question: 'Can I make my goals public?',

      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the difference between sharing and collaborating?',

      {
        question: 'How do I turn off notifications?',

        question: 'Why am I not receiving notifications?',
